This report presents the results of my Master's Thesis in Cybernetics and Robotics at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) during Spring 2019. 

The project was carried out in cooperation with Kongsberg Maritime, which is a well established supplier of autonomous marine systems and thus a party of interest on the subject of route planning methods for ships. Many thanks go to my advisor Morten Breivik, co-advisor Glenn Ivan Bitar, and advisors Jon Bernhard Høstmark and Even Ødegaard from Kongsberg Maritime for valuable guidance and feedback throughout the project.

This thesis explores optimal route planning solutions for ships, which are then validated using Kongsberg ECDIS and benchmarked using the  Kongsberg Digital Martime Simulator.
