abstract = {We present Kinodynamic RRT*, an incremental sampling-based approach for asymptotically optimal motion planning for robots with linear dynamics. Our approach extends RRT*, which was introduced for holonomic robots [10], by using a fixed-final-state-free-final-time controller that optimally connects any pair of states, where the cost function is expressed as a trade-off between the duration of a trajectory and the expended control effort. Our approach generalizes earlier work on RRT* for kinodynamic systems, as it guarantees asymptotic optimality for any system with controllable linear dynamics, in state spaces of any dimension. In addition, we show that for the rich subclass of systems with a nilpotent dynamics matrix, closed-form solutions for optimal trajectories can be derived, which keeps the computational overhead of our algorithm compared to traditional RRT* at a minimum. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by computing asymptotically optimal trajectories in three challenging motion planning scenarios: (i) a planar robot with a 4-D state space and double integrator dynamics, (ii) an aerial vehicle with a 10-D state space and linearized quadrotor dynamics, and (iii) a car-like robot with a 5-D state space and non-linear dynamics.},

	Abstract = {One of the ultimate goals in Robotics is to create autonomous robots. Such robots will accept high-level descriptions of tasks and will execute them without further human intervention. The input descriptions will specify what the user wants done rather than how to do it. The robots will be any kind of versatile mechanical device equipped with actuators and sensors under the control of a computing system. Making progress toward autonomous robots is of major practical inter{\^A}- est in a wide variety of application domains including manufacturing, construction, waste management, space exploration, undersea work, as{\^A}- sistance for the disabled, and medical surgery. It is also of great technical interest, especially for Computer Science, because it raises challenging and rich computational issues from which new concepts of broad useful{\^A}- ness are likely to emerge. Developing the technologies necessary for autonomous robots is a formidable undertaking with deep interweaved ramifications in auto{\^A}- mated reasoning, perception and control. It raises many important prob{\^A}- lems. One of them - motion planning - is the central theme of this book. It can be loosely stated as follows: How can a robot decide what motions to perform in order to achieve goal arrangements of physical objects? This capability is eminently necessary since, by definition, a robot accomplishes tasks by moving in the real world. The minimum one would expect from an autonomous robot is the ability to plan its x Preface own motions.},

@article{kuwata2009,
	Abstract = {This paper describes a real-time motion planning algorithm, based on the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) approach, applicable to autonomous vehicles operating in an urban environment. Extensions to the standard RRT are predominantly motivated by: 1) the need to generate dynamically feasible plans in real-time; 2) safety requirements; 3) the constraints dictated by the uncertain operating (urban) environment. The primary novelty is in the use of closed-loop prediction in the framework of RRT. The proposed algorithm was at the core of the planning and control software for Team MIT's entry for the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge, where the vehicle demonstrated the ability to complete a 60 mile simulated military supply mission, while safely interacting with other autonomous and human driven vehicles.},
